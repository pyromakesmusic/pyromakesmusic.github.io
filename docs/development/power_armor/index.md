title: PÂ¥RO || Powered Exoskeleton Development
---

Bionic powered exoskeletons represent an area of significant potential development with respect to both software and
hardware. 

From the hardware angle, existing exoskeletons are often bulky, with few degrees of freedom and major 
restrictions on user movement. Developing a chassis that can deliver augmentations in power, force, speed, or stability 
is a non-trivial task. Additionally, selecting actuators that are lightweight and low-profile while still fulfilling
desired operational characteristics is a potentially complex problem involving numerous tradeoffs. Selecting sensors
that can provide the right kinds of raw signal necessary for control is another problem strongly coupled with both of those.

In terms of software, any set of sensors and actuators will require control logic, in addition to digital signal
processing to ensure the cleanest and most responsive performance. With larger numbers of actuators and sensors, the
problem of coordinating action between all the elements of the exoskeleton grows in complexity. Big data approaches
involving machine learning are a potential aid to this problem, but will likely require tuning and a good deal of trial 
and error to find something both effective and computationally efficient.
