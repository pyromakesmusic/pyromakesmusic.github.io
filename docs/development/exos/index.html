title: ExOS

ExOS is an operating system designed to run powered exoskeletons. Currently the most support is designed towards the use
of fluid (McKibben) muscles. Since the project incorporates pyonics, which itself is built around the Klampt library for
Python initially developed at Duke University, other types of actuators could potentially be integrated.
