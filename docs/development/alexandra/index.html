<p>Alexandra is a tool that uses Google's Tesseract Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolkit to snip text displayed
anywhere on the screen and automatically put it into the clipboard, whether it is contained in a PDF, a UI element,
or an image.

Originally developed in order to capture edit history from FL Studio, I realized the potential application space was much
larger and could be used for all sorts of things. It is a handy little bit of code, and pretty simple. So far I have
only tested it on computer-generated text, so how it performs on things like handwriting still needs to be fleshed out.</p>
