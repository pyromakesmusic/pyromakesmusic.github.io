automusic is a Python project for the algorithmic generation of music. Built using principles of graph theory, automusic
can generate random chord progressions.

Future development plans include allowing the generation of MIDI files from the chord progressions, rhythmic variations,
integrating the rules of counterpoint to create melodies, key changes, and using chord change probabilities derived from
popular music rather than simply manipulating chord change probabilities based on number of shared notes.
